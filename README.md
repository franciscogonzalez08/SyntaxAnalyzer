# SyntaxAnalyzer
<p>Syntax/logic analyzer made with semantic trees for logic propositions.</p>
<p>SYMBOLS</p>
<p>- PROPOSITIONS: All lower case letters (excluding 'Ã±' character)</p>
<p>- NEGATION: ~</p>
<p>- CONJUNCTION: &</p>
<p>- DISJUNCTION: |</p>
<p>- IMPLICATION: -> (two chars)</p>
<p>- DOUBLE IMPLICATION: <-> (three chars)</p>
  
-----------------INSTRUCTIONS-------------------
  
 HOW DOES IT WORKS?
 1. You'll be asked to type how many propositions you want before 
 the conclusion.
 2. Type the logic propositions 1 by 1
 (logic propositions MUST be between parentheses)
 3. Finally, type the conclusion
 (MUST be between parentheses)
 <P>PARENTHESES MAY NOT APPEAR ON ATOMIC PROPOSITIONS</P>
